* Uniques
  * Pearl of Asia [Father Governs Children]
  Food and Culture increased by 50% from friendly City-States
  >The Philippines was historically composed of warring/trading city-states that monopolized on sea-going trade routes before the arrival of Europeans
  
  * Katipunan [Replaces Rifleman]
  A unique early-modern era unit of the Philippines. Sacrificing offensive capabilities for a cheap, guerilla-like defense alternative.
  >Based on revolutionaries and rebel groups that garnered under the same name. The Katipunan is less of a traditional land army and moreof opportunistic marauders. Being able to pick their own fights and battles to counteract their equipment and training inferiority compared to the Spanish and American armies.
  
  * Rice Terraces
  A game-start improvement that easily counter-balances the Philippine's disadvantageous early-game position. Provides +1 culture and +1food (+1 upon Fertilizer) when built on a Hill. It's crop yield increases if there is an adjacent mountain tile.
  >Nestled inbetween hills, like stairs to heaven, the Rice Terraces of Banaue are one of the national wonders of the Philippines. Built by hand by the ancient ancestors of the Filipinos' indigenous inhabitants, it provided sustainable food and supply for civilization and Human habitation to prosper in an otherwise untamed frontier.

### Other Features
-Complete set of city names native to the Philippines.

-Unique Jose Rizal dialogue, from greeting you to disdaining you, either ripping off from his real-life quotes or stereotyping Filipino sentimentalities.

-Semi-finished symbol-work for the units and nation. Still can't make a good sprite for the Rice Terrace however.

### Issues
-Don't have proper FantasyHex sprites for the units and improvements

-Father Governs Children's unique name can't be changed for God knows what reason, I'll ask Yairm later on about this or some other professional modder

-I am devoid of game-sense balance. If any of the units/improvements and uniques feel under/overpowered, please let me know and you can recommend some tips to aid me while you're at it
