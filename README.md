  * Pearl of Asia [Father Governs Children]
  Food and Culture increased by 50% from friendly City-States
  >The Philippines was historically composed of warring/trading city-states that monopolized on sea-going trade routes before the arrival of Europeans
  
  * Katipunan [Replaces Rifleman]
  A unique early-modern era unit of the Philippines. Sacrificing offensive capabilities for a cheap, guerilla-like defense alternative.
  >Based on revolutionaries and rebel groups that garnered under the same name. The Katipunan is less of a traditional land army and moreof opportunistic marauders. Being able to pick their own fights and battles to counteract their equipment and training inferiority compared to the Spanish and American armies.
  
  * Rice Terraces
  A game-start improvement that easily counter-balances the Philippine's disadvantageous early-game position. Provides +1 culture and +1food (+1 upon Fertilizer) when built on a Hill. It's crop yield increases if there is an adjacent mountain tile.
  >Nestled inbetween hills, like stairs to heaven, the Rice Terraces of Banaue are one of the national wonders of the Philippines. Built by hand by the ancient ancestors of the Filipinos' indigenous inhabitants, it provided sustainable food and supply for civilization and Human habitation to prosper in an otherwise untamed frontier.
